# Superlist Bulk import Preprocessor

Superlist, when used with WP Ultimate CSV Importer, has many underlying limitations for bulk import.

Motivation of this project is to create a pre processing script that will run before data is fed inside WP Ultimate CSV Importer. This pre processing script will convert input data into a format that is compatible with Superlist.

Also this script will help us in decreasing manual effort of our data entry team, thus saving a lot of time and causing less number of errors.
