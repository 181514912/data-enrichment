# Superlist Bulk import Preprocessor

Superlist, when used with CSV Import all has many underlying limitations for bulk import.

Motivation of this project is to create a pre processing script in the input csv file for CSV Import All. This pre processing script will convert input data into a format that is compatible with Superlist.

Also this script will help us in decreasing manual effort of our data entry team. It will thus save a lot of time and cause less number of errors.
