By breaking down projects into smaller iterations and deploying working software frequently, we effectively speed up our delivery process. We use web-based project management and collaboration tools such as Trac and Redmine to ensure that our projects stay on track. Clients are given access to these tools so that they remain updated on the project status as we design, develop, test and deliver applications.
