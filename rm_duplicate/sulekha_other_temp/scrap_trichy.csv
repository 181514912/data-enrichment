The Placement team works closely with companies in the Design and Media industry to identify their skilled-talent requirements. Once the team gets to know about an opportunity, it seeks clear requirements, shortlists profiles, sends profiles to employers and arranges interview for shortlisted students.
In case of mass recruitment drives, the Placement department trains the students on specific employer needs, before sending the students to the interview. This is also done as a service to organizations that continuously recruit our students year-on-year. So far, the Placement department has been highly successful in placing its students in top-notch companies around the world.
