The Gurukul has been established for imparting value based education to children from an early age. Modernization, high-end technological advances and intellectual progress in these years, unfortunately, have not contributed to the building of a great character.We shoulder the responsibility to mould the future by training the younger generation. We strongly feel that this is the era to revive the age-old Guru-Shishya Parampara for the sake of the younger generation, the Global Citizens of tomorrow. With the world coming closer and closer to the concept of a Global Village, the advent and advancement of technology has only increased the pace of life. An effort has to be made to make the youngsters aware of their ancient Indian culture and the deep rooted ethos of the holy soil of our country. The Gurukul system is the perfect technique to blend the modern technological advancements and the ancient Indian culture to create a new breed of winning personalities.
This time tested education system of ancient India develops an emotional, intellectual and spiritual bond between the Guru and the Shishya. The Guru takes the Shishya from the darkness of ignorance towards the enlightenment of knowledge. He guides the Shishya not only to pursue knowledge, but also to build a character.Today what we desperately need is not more advanced technology but men and women of strong character, who are self-disciplined and capable of being global citizens who can make the utmost utilization of technology for the benefit of the mankind.Let's not forget that a nation is always built by disciplined, cultured, devoted and educated citizens who have full faith in the self and the nation. This faith and discipline can be best imbibed in the children at tender ages which will compel them to concentrate on character building and develop a sense of cross cultural tolerance, co-operation and harmony.Ambition Gurukul is committed to these ideals with its faith in incorporating such qualities in its students to make them physically strong, mentally alert and spiritually elevated. Ambition Gurukul is our offering for young school students so that we can catch them young and shape their minds to succeed in whatever endeavour they wish to follow in their lives. Ambition Gurukul wishes to mentor students by making a difference in the way Students think and approach problems. We will employ and develop ways to enhance Students IQ. We will leave a permanent mark on the Students who have undergone training at Ambition Gurukul. In other words we will change lives by empowering students by providing them Knowledge, Skill and Attitudes that will make them a winner in every stage of their lives.Ambition Gurukul is a venture by the Ambition Educational Society. Ambition Educational Group has been a pioneer in quality education since 2009 and has set newer benchmarks of quality in technical education. The groups first educational venture, Ambition Institute of Technology, was established in the year 2009 with the mission of giving to the nation enlightened citizens prepared with the technical knowledge and power to CREATE. Since its inception, the group has emerged to be a leader in the engineering and polytechnic domains.With the effect that our value based teaching methods have had on the lives and success of our students and their families, there emerged a demand from Parents, that the group undertakes a venture to educate younger children in order to create a solid foundation for their lives.Ambition Gurukul aims at providing students Wholesome School Education through its comprehensive school programs, integrated classroom programs, specialised courses for competitive exam preparations and other national scholastic examinations like the KVPY, NTSE, Olympiads and other exams. We are committed to develop a culture of learning and an environment where Students will be trained for the best in the world through methodologies and practices that are truly world class yet deep rooted in the ancient Indian system of learning.

We deal in Abacus & Mental Arithmetic Coaching.Abacus in not a class for teaching mental maths but it uses this as an aid for the child's mental development. Mental Maths obviously gets vastly improved as a consequence & the fear of Maths is removed. Abacus inculcates an interest in Mathematics. Initially mental maths is taught thru Abacus but as the child completes the different levels, Abacus as a tool is removed.
It is observed that when children do fast mental calculations using our time tested techniques they need to use their Creativity, Concentration, Vision, Memory, Listening Skills, Logic, Imagination, Analysis, they need to use both their Left and Right parts of the brain, thus increasing COORDINATION and Exercising the whole brain.
Thus the mind gets exercised constantly
The ancient Abacus tool now modified gets the child to use the three senses simultaneously - Seeing - Hearing - Doing . After some months when the physical Abacus is taken away from them, they visualize the beads mentally using the virtual/visual Abacus, thus increasing their Memory-
The child will be able to calculate with speed and accuracy using his own mental abilities and can even beat the speed of calculator also. So We are BEST ABACUS CLASSES PROVIDER IN VARANASI (UTTAR PRADESH, INDIA).Contact us for further details.
