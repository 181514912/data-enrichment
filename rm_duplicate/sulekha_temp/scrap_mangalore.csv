Although there were a lot of educational institutions in the region, the general perception was that getting into premier institutions was extremely difficult, if not impossible. CFAL sought to change this mindset head-on.Since that start in 2009, CFAL has seen tremendous success. In 2011, CFAL had the highest student selections in Mangalore for IIT and AIEEE entrance exams as well as in the National Talent Search Exam (NTSE).
