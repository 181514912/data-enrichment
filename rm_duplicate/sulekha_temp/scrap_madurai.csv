Visiting more and more Schools in our state, including State Board, CBSE and ICSE Schools, We found that the students, lack of proper information about professional educational courses ie.. Competitive Exams. More importantly, what weve planned is to give the best possible advice to the students thro Social Medias and our presentations. During our interaction with students in various Schools, we see always, the students show more interests to write Competitive Exams like JEE-MAIN&ADV and AIPMT Exams. But they feel reluctant to join preparatory courses.This reluctance halts them facing competitive exam challenges. Apart, students Basic, Fundamental, Conceptual and Analytical abilities are below to the required level. This theoretical based syllabus also put them down. These low level thoughts have to be precisely taken care and sharply motivated by giving them a new and challengeable program. We both believe, Education is the action or process of training or providing information for a change in skills, knowledge and behaviors. In that way, we hope, students realize the need of Learning is to gain knowledge or understanding of or skill by study, instruction or experience. We teach or train the learners all the above three through creativity, curiosity, self-direction, problem solving, personal responsibility and persistence in learning. Contact us for more details.
