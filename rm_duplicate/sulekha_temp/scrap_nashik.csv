Ever since our inception in 1996 WLCI has aimed to be the leading professional training provider for young people across India. Today we are proud to say we have not only surpassed that objective but also achieved a whole lot more. What started from a single campus in Delhi has now expanded to over 30 locations across the Indian subcontinent; making us one of the largest professional training institutions of the region. Today we have campuses in cities such as Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Pune, Chennai, New Delhi, Nodia, Kolkata, Jaipur, Luck now, Nagpur, Vishakapatnam, Goa, Vijawada, Varanasi, Indore, Udaipur, Jammu, Nasik, Bhubaneswar, Ahmedabad, Vadodra, Srinagar, Hubli, Chandigarh, Shimla, Aurangabad and Kathmandu. Across all these campuses students get access to the same high-class academic and professional training that sets them apart from their peers in other institutions. Our first programmes were in the area of business; however through increased interface with our industry partners and looking at global demand and supply needs we started providing training in creative areas such as Fashion, Advertising and Graphic Design and Media as well. Right from our inception we have always kept ourselves ahead by constantly innovating around areas that would help our students stand out from the crowd. Our biggest achievement till date is the Traineeship System, which has been running successfully since the year 1999. With the cooperation of our industry partners, all our graduate students undergo a traineeship along with their academic training and get a direct insight into their area of specialization while being mentored by an industry professional and earning an attractive stipend as well. No other institution in India offers such a program to its students. WLCI is the perfect place for you to grow  academically, professionally and personally!
